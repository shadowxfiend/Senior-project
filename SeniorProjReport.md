# Senior-project
senior project


This project is to create and network with raspberri pi and to teach others on how code parallel programing through this and how set up a similar network.



The current progress is mainly research on how to do this. Learning how to set up raspberry pi and how to code with C

we created a basic site to hose the lessons on. I created the multiple links and webpages coming from the homepage while joshua create the hommpage itself.

Sanju is working on connecting the various raspberry pis to the main hub. Connor and Joshua give help with it and help research on things Sanju is having trouble with.

For Senior Project II class we will divide up the lessons into different catergories and we will create lessons for others to learn.

While doing all of this we will create a list of steps necessary so that when others try to do this they can copy what we did and get their own raspberry PI to work.
